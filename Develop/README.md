## Description
This is a daily shedule calendar.
Based on the time of the day the collor of the time block will change 


## Why
We created this to help us schedule our day

## What did I learn 
I learned how to use jquere. We also use splice for the firtst time. This helped with compairing the containers to the current time. This portions gave me the most trouble when working through this challenge.
